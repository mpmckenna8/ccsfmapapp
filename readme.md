CCSF Online Map

To include all the campuses.

Allow user to search by building name.

Get relevant information into OpenStreetMap while maintaining copies of other
relevant data.

Points for each campus to be used as labels at higher zoom levels are in a
shapes directory.



Technology used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bower, to install and manage the web stuff
- Leaflet.js to show a map
- Jquery-ui and jquery to mess around with the DOM and make simple nice looking
  things
- Other stuff depending on what is wanted
  Most of the data is based off of data in OpenStreetMap with some supplemental files in the shapes folder.

  

To Do's,
- Document workflow, how to requisite data out of OSM and into project or create
  supplemental datasets for which the data doesn't really make sense to add to
  OSM.
- Create a initial launch page similar to bootmap but built from scratch
- Fill in each campus dropdown with relevant info, such as buildings for each
  campus
- Create a data set of offices or other imporant campus features
